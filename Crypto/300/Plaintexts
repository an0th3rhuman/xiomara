Dear Batman,
Their morals, their code; it's a bad joke.
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.
They're only as good as the world allows them to be.
You'll see- I'll show you.
When the chips are down these, uh, civilized people?
They'll eat each other.
Here you go Batman, this is what you seek:

See I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve.
Yours lovingly,
Joker.
